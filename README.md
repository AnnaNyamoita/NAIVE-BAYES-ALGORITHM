# Naive Bayes Classifier for Breast Cancer Prediction
This repository contains an implementation of the Naive Bayes Classifier to predict breast cancer. 
The goal of this project was to develop a model that can accurately classify breast tumors as benign or malignant based on specific features.
## Description
Breast cancer is a serious health concern, and early detection plays a crucial role in improving patient outcomes. 
In this project, we have implemented the Naive Bayes Classifier, a popular machine learning algorithm, to predict breast cancer.
## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of various features extracted from breast tumor samples, along with their corresponding labels 
(benign or malignant). These features include attributes such as the mean radius, texture, perimeter, and smoothness.
## Naive Bayes Classifier
The Naive Bayes Classifier is a probabilistic algorithm that uses Bayes' theorem with the "naive" assumption of feature independence.
Despite its simplicity, it has shown good performance in many classification tasks. In this project, we leveraged an implementation
of the Naive Bayes Classifier obtained from an online source to learn patterns from the dataset and make predictions on unseen breast tumor samples.
